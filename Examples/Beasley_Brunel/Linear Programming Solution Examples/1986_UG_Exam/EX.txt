A carpenter makes tables and chairs. 
Each table can be sold for a profit of £30 and each chair for a profit of £10. 
The carpenter can afford to spend up to 40 hours per week working and takes six hours to make a table and three hours to make a chair. 
Customer demand requires that he makes at least three times as many chairs as tables. 
Tables take up four times as much storage space as chairs and there is room for at most four tables each week.

Formulate this problem as a linear programming problem and solve it (graphically) using google ortools and python.







Solution
Variables
Let

xT = number of tables made per week

xC = number of chairs made per week

Constraints
total work time
6xT + 3xC <= 40

customer demand
xC >= 3xT

storage space
(xC/4) + xT <= 4

all variables >= 0
Objective
maximise 30xT + 10xC

The graphical representation of the problem is given below and from that we have that the solution lies at the intersection of

(xC/4) + xT = 4 and 6xT + 3xC = 40

Solving these two equations simultaneously we get xC = 10.667, xT = 1.333 and the corresponding profit = £146.667
