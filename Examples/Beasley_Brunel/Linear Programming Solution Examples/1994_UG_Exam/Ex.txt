A company is involved in the production of two items (X and Y). 
The resources need to produce X and Y are twofold, namely machine time for automatic processing and craftsman time for hand finishing. 
The table below gives the number of minutes required for each item:

         Machine time Craftsman time
Item X   13           20
     Y   19           29

The company has 40 hours of machine time available in the next working week but only 35 hours of craftsman time. 
Machine time is costed at £10 per hour worked and craftsman time is costed at £2 per hour worked. 
Both machine and craftsman idle times incur no costs. The revenue received for each item produced (all production is sold) is £20 for X and £30 for Y. 
The company has a specific contract to produce 10 items of X per week for a particular customer.

Formulate the problem of deciding how much to produce per week as a linear program.
Solve this linear program graphically.






ACHTUNG! Ab hier Spoiler für die Lösung:

Solution
Let

x be the number of items of X
y be the number of items of Y
then the LP is:

maximise

20x + 30y - 10(machine time worked) - 2(craftsman time worked)
subject to:

13x + 19y <= 40(60) machine time
20x + 29y <= 35(60) craftsman time
x >= 10 contract
x,y >= 0
so that the objective function becomes

maximise

20x + 30y - 10(13x + 19y)/60 - 2(20x + 29y)/60
i.e. maximise

17.1667x + 25.8667y
subject to:

13x + 19y <= 2400
20x + 29y <= 2100
x >= 10
x,y >= 0
