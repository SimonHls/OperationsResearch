Linear programming example 1995 UG exam

The demand for two products in each of the last four weeks is shown below.

                         Week
                      1  2  3  4
Demand - product 1    23 27 34 40
Demand - product 2    11 13 15 14
Apply exponential smoothing with a smoothing constant of 0.7 to generate a forecast for the demand for these products in week 5.

These products are produced using two machines, X and Y. Each unit of product 1 that is produced requires 15 minutes processing on machine X and 25 minutes processing on machine Y. Each unit of product 2 that is produced requires 7 minutes processing on machine X and 45 minutes processing on machine Y. The available time on machine X in week 5 is forecast to be 20 hours and on machine Y in week 5 is forecast to be 15 hours. Each unit of product 1 sold in week 5 gives a contribution to profit of £10 and each unit of product 2 sold in week 5 gives a contribution to profit of £4.

It may not be possible to produce enough to meet your forecast demand for these products in week 5 and each unit of unsatisfied demand for product 1 costs £3, each unit of unsatisfied demand for product 2 costs £1.

Formulate the problem of deciding how much of each product to make in week 5 as a linear program.
Solve this linear program graphically.

TIP: The exponential smoothing formula is Mt = µYt + (1- µ)Mt-1 , With µ = smoothing constant (0.7), Yt = Actual Value at time t, Mt = forecast value at time t 
We use M1 as the forecast for month 2, etc.




Solution


Note that the first part of the question is a forecasting question so it is solved below.

For product 1 applying exponential smoothing with a smoothing constant of 0.7 we get:

M1 = Y1 = 23
M2 = 0.7Y2 + 0.3M1 = 0.7(27) + 0.3(23) = 25.80
M3 = 0.7Y3 + 0.3M2 = 0.7(34) + 0.3(25.80) = 31.54
M4 = 0.7Y4 + 0.3M3 = 0.7(40) + 0.3(31.54) = 37.46

The forecast for week five is just the average for week 4 = M4 = 37.46 = 37 (as we cannot have fractional demand).

For product 2 applying exponential smoothing with a smoothing constant of 0.7 we get:

M1 = Y1 = 11
M2 = 0.7Y2 + 0.3M1 = 0.7(13) + 0.3(11) = 12.40
M3 = 0.7Y3 + 0.3M2 = 0.7(15) + 0.3(12.40) = 14.22
M4 = 0.7Y4 + 0.3M3 = 0.7(14) + 0.3(14.22) = 14.07

The forecast for week five is just the average for week 4 = M4 = 14.07 = 14 (as we cannot have fractional demand).

We can now formulate the LP for week 5 using the two demand figures (37 for product 1 and 14 for product 2) derived above.

Let

x1 be the number of units of product 1 produced

x2 be the number of units of product 2 produced

where x1, x2>=0

The constraints are:

15x1 + 7x2 <= 20(60) machine X

25x1 + 45x2 <= 15(60) machine Y

x1 <= 37 demand for product 1

x2 <= 14 demand for product 2

The objective is to maximise profit, i.e.

maximise 10x1 + 4x2 - 3(37- x1) - 1(14-x2)

i.e. maximise 13x1 + 5x2 - 125

The graph is shown below, from the graph we have that the solution occurs on the horizontal axis (x2=0) at x1=36 at which point the maximum profit is 13(36) + 5(0) - 125 = £343
