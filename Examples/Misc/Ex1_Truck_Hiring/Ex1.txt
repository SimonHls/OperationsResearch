A transport company has two types of trucks, Type A and Type B. Type A has a refrigerated capacity of 20 and a non-refrigerated capacity of 40. In contrast, Type B has the same overall volume with equal refrigerated and non-refrigerated stock sections. A grocer must hire trucks to transport 3000 of refrigerated stock and 4000 of non-refrigerated stock. The cost per kilometre of Type A is 30, and 40 for Type B. How many trucks of each type should the grocer rent to achieve the minimum total cost?
