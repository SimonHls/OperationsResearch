You have:

200 resistors, 120 transistors, 150 capacitors

and you produce two types of circuits:
Type A requires 20 resistors, 10 transistors and 10 capacitors.
Type B requires 10 resistors, 20 transistors and 30 capacitors.

If the profit of type A is 5 and that of type B is 12, how many circuits of each should we produce to maximize profits?
