# Simons Operations Research Repo

_This repo is a work in progress. I plan to add more examples as i solve more problems. All problems solved here are either my own creations or from public sources._

## About this repo

This repo contains some optimiziation problems and their solutions. As a solver, i will use [Googles OR-Tools library](https://developers.google.com/optimization) with python.

The repo is sorted by problem type. Right now, i am mostly interested in solving linear programming problems, but in the future i hope to add more complex examples as well as other problem types.

Code in this repo is either written by me or by marked sources. AI-written code is also marked as such.

## Useful resources

Most of my knowledge about OR comes from online sources. For reference, i will link some of the best ones i've found.

### General knowledge

#### [OR-Tools by Google](https://developers.google.com/optimization)

The reason this repo exists. OR-Tools is great!

### Sample Exercises

#### [OR-Notes by J E Beasley](https://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/or/contents.html)

A beautiful web-1.0 page containing a lot of information about OR. It also contains a wealth of example problems, some of which are solved in this repo.
